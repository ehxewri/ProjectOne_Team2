House Price Predictor 

A home is essential to modern day living and with rising costs and a struggling economy it has become even harder to find a good place to live. If only there was a tool that could make buying a new home a piece of cake instead of a generational gamble. In this project we will investigatve affordability of housing in the dallas metro area. 
The major factors we will use are population, household income, and the housing price index.
By using all of these factors We will look at the past 10 years. And visualize the current cost of home ownership today. We will also visualize the corrilation of population, income and housing costs.
Lastly, we will look at projecting where house cost will be over the next 5 years. 

First, we limit this to the county of Plano. We then use the model to look at other counties in the Dallas Ft Worth Metropolitan area.
