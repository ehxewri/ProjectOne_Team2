House Price Predictor 

A home is essential to modern day living and with rising costs and a struggling economy it has become even harder to find a good place to live. If only there was a tool that could make buying a new home a piece of cake instead of a generational gamble. In this project we will investigatve affordability of housing in the dallas metro area. 
The major factors we will use are population, household income, and the housing price index.
By using all of these factors We will look at the past data from 1997 to present day and document the growth and trends in the housing market. We will also visualize the corrilation of population, income and housing costs.
Lastly, we will look to project where the housing cost will be over the next 2 years.


 We started with three of the biggest counties in North Texas.For each county we collected a data series which included: housing price index(HPI), population(POP), and houshold income(HI). 

 
 The three counties being Collin, Dallas, and Denton. We structured our model to be able to then use the model to look at other counties in the Dallas Ft Worth Metropolitan area.

# Overview

Going into this project we predicted that there would be a stronger correlation between household income and the housing price index than the population and the housing price index.
 
With the data we collected we were able to graph out and analyze the trends in the data to show the correlation between HPI, POP, and HI.

1. The immigration to Dallas based on the housing market and how much the housing market has been affected based on the last ten year and project the growth in the next five years. How many houses there are available compared on the amount of houses needed.
Housing market. Where is the best place to invest in the Dallas Fort Worth area?
Limit the amount of counties we use. Amount 3-5 counties

Average housing cost over ten years
Census data for the last ten years ( to show how much the population growth to the housing cost by county) 12 - 24 months.
Does population growth correlate to housing cost?
